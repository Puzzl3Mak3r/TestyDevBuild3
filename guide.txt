main.lua - Main function/scene/file handler for what is going on in the screen, will call other functions based on Keywords.csv and temp.csv (this is located in local Documents folder)

\Spaces - File for loading worlds, levels
\Core - The functions that is called by main.lua; it does all the computing, so it's very easy to mod just by using that
\Assets - I think yall know what this is for
\Addons - Stuff that other ppl have made outside of this repository. Hopefully I remember to credit them
